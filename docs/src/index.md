# HighDimMixedModels.jl

[HighDimMixedModels.jl](https://github.com/solislemuslab/HighDimMixedModels.jl) is a package for fitting regularized linear mixed-effect models to high dimensional, clustered data. It is a Julia implementation of the estimation approach in

Two options for penalties are provided, the original LASSO and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty described in
